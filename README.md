## Uchaguzi Huru

Uchaguzi Huru is an initiative co-founded by four not-for-profit organizations; Transparency International-Kenya, Mzalendo Trust, Elections Observation Group (ELOG) and the Africa Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption. The initiative is aimed at tracking and monitoring the misuse of state resources during elections, which has over the years emerged as a huge threat to democracy in Kenya.

The integrity of our electoral system and our democracy was aptly preserved by the makers of The Constitution of Kenya 2010 through the National Values and Principles of Governance enshrined in it, through provisions in Chapter Six on Leadership and Integrity, Article 38 on Political Rights, General Principles of the Electoral System and Article 201, Principles of Public Finance and through various statutes on elections, for example the Elections Act. However, the use of state resources to influence elections has remained a thorn in the flesh of these provisions of the law, and as a result, electoral integrity remains a mirage.

It is on the backdrop of this that these institutions have partnered to find a solution to this perennial problem. It is our firm belief that through partnerships with other stakeholders, including but not limited to journalists, trained monitors, election observers, concerned public officials and citizens we can monitor, track and expose the misuse and abuse of state resources in elections. 

This platform provides a simple, safe, confidential space for anyone and everyone to report any sighting of misuse/abuse of state resources in campaigns. The information collected including any personal information will be stored safely and will solely be used in strict confidentiality to shine a spotlight on election malpractice.
